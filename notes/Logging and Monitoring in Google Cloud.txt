Module 1PIntroduction to Google CLoud's Operations Suite
  - In this module, we will take some time to do a high-level overview of the various products which comprise Google Cloud’s logging, 
  monitoring, and observability suite.

  Learning Objectives
    1. Describe the purpose and capabilities of Google Cloud’s operations suite
    2. Explain the purpose of the Cloud Monitoring tool.
    3. Explain the purpose of Cloud Logging and Error Reporting tools.
    4. Explain the purpose of Application Performance Management tools.
    5. Explain the purpose of Cloud Trace

  Need for google Cloud observability
    1. Visibility into system health
      - help me understand my app and tell if it's healthy

    2. Error reporting and alerting
      - bring problems directly to my attention

    3. Efficient troubleshooting
      - help me fix it if it's broken

    4. Performance improvement

    Monitoring
      - gives you real-time sys information
      - collecting, processing, aggregating and displaying real-time quanitative data about a sys such as:
        - query counts and types
        - error counts and types
        - processing times
        - server lifetimes
      - foundation of product reliability

    What's needed from products?
      1. Continual improvement
      2. Dashboards
      3. Automated alerts
      4. Incident response

    Four golden signals
      1. latency
        - changes in latency could indicate emerging issues
        - its values may be tied to capacity demands
        - it can be used to measure sys improvements

        How?
          - page load latency
          - number of req waiting for a thread
          - service response time
          - transaction duration
          - time to first response 
          - and time to complete data return.

      2. Traffic
        - indicator of current sys demands
        - historical trends are used for capacity planning
        - core measure when calculating infra spend

        How?
          -  number of HTTP requests per second
          - number of requests for static vs. dynamic content
          - number of concurrent sessions

      3. Saturation
        - indicator of how full the service is
        - focuses on the most constrained resources
        - freqntly tied to degrading performance as capacity is reached
        
        How?
          - percentage memory utilization
          - percentage of thread pool utilization
          - percentage of cache utilization

      4. errors
        - indicate configuration or capacity issues
        - indicate service level objective violations
        - error might mean it's time to send out an alert

  Quiz
    1. You want a simple way to see the latency of requests for a web application you deployed to Cloud Run. What Google Cloud tool should you use?
      - Trace

    2. You want to examine messages generated by running code. Which tool might be best for doing this?
      - Logs Explorer

    3. Users have reported that an application occasionally returns garbage data instead of the intended results, but you have been unable to reproduce this problem in your test environment. Which tool might be of best help?
      - Error Reporting
      
      - Logs Explorer

    4. You want to calculate the uptime of a service and receive alerts if the uptime value falls below a certain threshold. Which tool will help you with this requirement?
      - Cloud Monitoring

      - Profiler
