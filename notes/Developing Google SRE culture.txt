  Quiz
    1. What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?
      - Practices that balance the velocity of development features with the risk to reliability.

  KeyPoints and Reflection Activity
    Key KeyPoints
      - Customer's experience w/ your service tell you how reliable it is
      - in it org, dev and op teams have conflicting priorities
      - SRE is the practice of balancing velocity of development features w/ the risk to reliability
      - SRE can benefit IT teams, rergardles of whether they are using cloud or on-premise tech, for both large projects and daily work
  
DevOps, SRE, and Why they exist
  This module explains the components of DevOps philosophy, 
  why Site Reliability Engineering came to exist, 
  and who in an organization can and should practice SRE.

  Learning Objectives
    - DevOps movement
    - Origin of SRE
    - WHo practices SRE
    - Distinguish between DevOps and SRE
    - Articulate the pillars of DevOps
    - Explain how SRE practices align to DevOps pillars

    DevOps and SRE
      Origin of SRE 
        - how to think about, measure, and incentivize reliability
        - shared standard comm between business and IT
        - 2003 by Benjamin Treynor Sloss
        - is a concrete way to solve problems that the DevOps philosophy addresses
        - a practice and a role
        - goal of SRE is to serve the business and the user, not the other way round.

      DevOps movement
        - strives to align principles, practices and incentives across dev and operations teams
        - aims to close the gap between software development and software operations
        
        Why it exists?
          - a culture/philosphy and not practices bet dev and Operators
            - culture means sustain

          Developers
            - responsible for writing code for systems
            - expected to be agile and often pushed to write and deploy new code as quickly as possible
            - want to work faster, innovating, and succeding or failing quickly

          Operators
            - responsible for ensuring that those sys operate reliably so customers are happy
            - expected to keep sys stable would prefer to work slower
            - focusing on reliability and consistency

        5 pillars of DevOps
          1. Reduce Organization Silos
            - increase collaboration by breaking down barriers across teams
            - SRE
              - Share Ownership

          2. Accept failure is normal
            - computers are inherently unreliable and human error
             - SRE
              - Blamelessness
                - Implement blameless postmortems.

          3. Implement Gradual Change
            - small incremental changes are easier to review
            - allows you to reduce the time to recover making it simple to roll back
            - SRE
              - Reduce cost of failure
                - Design thinking
              
          4. Leverage tooling and automation
            - key to helping your IT team work efficiently and focus on the tasks that matter
            - automate manual nonvolatile work
            - SRE
              - Toil automation

          5. Measure everything
            - critical gauge for success.
            - SRE
              - Measure toil and reliability

    Quiz
      1. Which philosophy closes the gap between development and operations?
        - DevOps

      2. How do DevOps and SRE relate to each other?
        - SRE is a way to implement DevOps. 

      3. Which is a key pillar of DevOps philosophy?
        - Accept failure as normal.

      4. Which is an SRE practice that promotes sharing ownership in IT?
        - Error budgets 
          - created shared incentive and ownership between developers and SREs.


    Exercise
      Key KeyPoints
        ● DevOps emerged to help close gaps and break down silos between
development and operations teams.
        ● DevOps is a philosophy, not a development methodology or
        technology.
        ● SRE is a practical way to implement DevOps philosophy.
        ● Developers focus on feature velocity and innovation; operators focus
        on reliability and consistency.
        ● SRE consists of both technical and cultural practices.


SLOs with Consequences
  - This module covers the value of SRE to an organization, 
  as well as the technical and cultural fundamentals related to reducing organizational silos and accepting failure as normal. \
  Topics include the SRE technical practices of blameless postmortems,...

  Learning Objectives
    - Understand the value SRE can provide to an organization.
    - Describe the technical fundamentals of SRE: SLOs, error budgets, and blameless postmortems.
    - Describe the cultural fundamentals of SRE: Blamelessness, psychological safety, unified vision, collaboration and communication, and knowledge sharing.

  SRE value
    Mission
      - to protect, provide for and progress software and systems w/ consitent focus
      of availability, latency, performance and capacity

    Practices/Norms
      1. Incentivize automation w/ time for creativity
        - lessen human error and more time for other creative projects

      2. Launching and iterating allows teams to fail fast
        - learn from failure and try again

    Note
      - need cultural amd org support for long term to be successful
  Postmortems

  Blamelessness and Psych Safely

  SLOs and error budgets

  Share vision and knowledge

  Quiz 
    1. What is one value SRE provides to an IT team?
      - Developers are enabled to work at a higher velocity while maintaining reliability.
        - 
    2. What are Site Reliability Engineers comfortable with?
      - Failure
    
    3. What is a reasonable degree of target reliability for an SLO?
      - 99.9%
        - 99.9% is a reasonable target for reliability as it is just short of 100% and still leaves room to focus on feature development.

    4. What can happen when team members don't feel psychologically safe?
      - Moments of learning are lost.
        - ple don’t speak up or ask questions in work environments with low psychological safety, therefore moments of learning are inevitably lost.

    5. What is your team's clear and compelling goal that it strives to achieve?
      - Mission
