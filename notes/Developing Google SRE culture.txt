  Quiz
    1. What is Site Reliability Engineering (SRE)?
      - Practices that balance the velocity of development features with the risk to reliability.

  KeyPoints and Reflection Activity
    Key KeyPoints
      - Customer's experience w/ your service tell you how reliable it is
      - in it org, dev and op teams have conflicting priorities
      - SRE is the practice of balancing velocity of development features w/ the risk to reliability
      - SRE can benefit IT teams, rergardles of whether they are using cloud or on-premise tech, for both large projects and daily work
  
Module 2: DevOps, SRE, and Why they exist
  This module explains the components of DevOps philosophy, 
  why Site Reliability Engineering came to exist, 
  and who in an organization can and should practice SRE.

  Learning Objectives
    - DevOps movement
    - Origin of SRE
    - WHo practices SRE
    - Distinguish between DevOps and SRE
    - Articulate the pillars of DevOps
    - Explain how SRE practices align to DevOps pillars

    DevOps and SRE
      Origin of SRE 
        - how to think about, measure, and incentivize reliability
        - shared standard comm between business and IT
        - 2003 by Benjamin Treynor Sloss
        - is a concrete way to solve problems that the DevOps philosophy addresses
        - a practice and a role
        - goal of SRE is to serve the business and the user, not the other way round.

      DevOps movement
        - strives to align principles, practices and incentives across dev and operations teams
        - aims to close the gap between software development and software operations
        
        Why it exists?
          - a culture/philosphy and not practices bet dev and Operators
            - culture means sustain

          Developers
            - responsible for writing code for systems
            - expected to be agile and often pushed to write and deploy new code as quickly as possible
            - want to work faster, innovating, and succeding or failing quickly

          Operators
            - responsible for ensuring that those sys operate reliably so customers are happy
            - expected to keep sys stable would prefer to work slower
            - focusing on reliability and consistency

        5 pillars of DevOps
          1. Reduce Organization Silos
            - increase collaboration by breaking down barriers across teams
            - SRE
              - Share Ownership

          2. Accept failure is normal
            - computers are inherently unreliable and human error
             - SRE
              - Blamelessness
                - Implement blameless postmortems.

          3. Implement Gradual Change
            - small incremental changes are easier to review
            - allows you to reduce the time to recover making it simple to roll back
            - SRE
              - Reduce cost of failure
                - Design thinking
              
          4. Leverage tooling and automation
            - key to helping your IT team work efficiently and focus on the tasks that matter
            - automate manual nonvolatile work
            - SRE
              - Toil automation

          5. Measure everything
            - critical gauge for success.
            - SRE
              - Measure toil and reliability

    Quiz
      1. Which philosophy closes the gap between development and operations?
        - DevOps

      2. How do DevOps and SRE relate to each other?
        - SRE is a way to implement DevOps. 

      3. Which is a key pillar of DevOps philosophy?
        - Accept failure as normal.

      4. Which is an SRE practice that promotes sharing ownership in IT?
        - Error budgets 
          - created shared incentive and ownership between developers and SREs.


    Exercise
      Key KeyPoints
        ● DevOps emerged to help close gaps and break down silos between
development and operations teams.
        ● DevOps is a philosophy, not a development methodology or
        technology.
        ● SRE is a practical way to implement DevOps philosophy.
        ● Developers focus on feature velocity and innovation; operators focus
        on reliability and consistency.
        ● SRE consists of both technical and cultural practices.


Module 3: SLOs with Consequences
  - This module covers the value of SRE to an organization, 
  as well as the technical and cultural fundamentals related to reducing organizational silos and accepting failure as normal. \
  Topics include the SRE technical practices of blameless postmortems,...

  Learning Objectives
    - Understand the value SRE can provide to an organization.
    - Describe the technical fundamentals of SRE: SLOs, error budgets, and blameless postmortems.
    - Describe the cultural fundamentals of SRE: Blamelessness, psychological safety, unified vision, collaboration and communication, and knowledge sharing.

  SRE value
    Mission
      - to protect, provide for and progress software and systems w/ consitent focus
      of availability, latency, performance and capacity

    Practices/Norms
      1. Incentivize automation w/ time for creativity
        - lessen human error and more time for other creative projects

      2. Launching and iterating allows teams to fail fast
        - learn from failure and try again

    Note
      - need cultural and org support for long term to be successful
 
  Blameless Postmortems/Retrospective
    - only focuses on the root causes of an incident.
    - incident is looked at objectively w/o designing a person or team as the root cause
    Exprerienced SREs 
      - are comfortable w/ failure
      - eliminate ambiguity w/ monitoring
      - establish and document processes.

    Components of a postmortem
      - details of the incident and its timeline
      - the actions taken to mitifate or resolve the incident
      - the incident's impact
      - Its trigger and root cause or causes
      - the follow-up actions to prevent its recurrence

    Goals
      - ensure that all the root casues are properly understood by the team
      - define or take effective actions to prevent the issue from occuring again
      - reduce the likelihood of stressful outages
      - avoid multiplying complexity
      - learn from your mistakes and thos of others
      - writing RCA provides additional vlue to your org
      - blamessness increase effectiveness of teams so 
      they can 100% focused on preventing from occuring instead of worrying about being blamed if something goes wrong

    RCA
      - root cause analysis
      - 5 whys minimum to find the culprit

  Blamelessness and Psych Safety
    Psychological safety
      - the belief that a person will not be punished or humiliated for speaking up 
      w/ ideas, questions, concerns, or mistakes

      Signs of low psychological safety
        - people  keep concerns or ideas to themselves
        - people are afraid of looking incompetent or ignorant

        Effect
          1. Prevents team members of small moments of learning
          2. Asking questions is key to brainstorming for leading to an out of the box or simple idea to solve the incident
          3. stifled learning and innovation

      How to build high psych safety?
        1. Frame work as a learning problem and not an execution problem
        2. Acknowledge your own fallibility
        3. Model curiosity

        Effects
          - bridging is encouraged
          - high cooperation
          - messengers are not punished when delivering bad news
          - failure is treated as opportunity for improvement
          - new ideas are welcomed
            - lead time,deployment frequency and time to restore
   
    Blamessness
      - fosters psych safety 

      Why do people blame?
        1. Hindsight Bias
          - is the tendency of people to overestimate their ability to have predicted an unpredictable outcome
          - can lead to blaming the person in charge

          Sample
            - Insisting that you knew that the losing team was goin to lose because you originally said you predicted it
        
        2. Discomfort discahrge
          - is when people blame others to discharge discomfort and pain at a neurobiological level

      How to not blame?
        1. Assume good intentions.
        2. Focus on systems and processesm not people
        3. Innovation requires ome degree of risk taking

  SLOs and error budgets
    - reduces org silos w/ SLOs and error budgets

    Notes
      - Software Engineering focuses on desgining and building
      - operating and maintaing estimated that 40-90% of total cost of ownership

    Shared responsibility
      Reliability/Availability (simple approach)
        - equals your service 'good' time divided by it's total time
        
        Advanced approach
        - equals to good interactions divided by total interactions

        Service reliability 
          - is about determining the amount of reliability you are trying to reach
          and the amount of downtime you are willing to tolerate.


      1. Error budgets
        - amount of downtime you are willing to tolerate
        - creates a common incentive for dev and SREs to find the right balance bet innovation and reliability


      2. Service-level objectives(SLOs)
        - precise numerical target for system reliability
        - targets that are agreed upon between stakeholders 
        - SLIs aggregated over time
        - short of 100%
          - 99.9
        - a promise about the health of your service to your customers

        How do you define SLOs?
          - Service-level indicators(SLIs)
            - measurable that answers
              - how well your service is doing at any moment in time?
            - expresed as a ratio of good events to valid events times 100%
            - map to user expecations
              - latency
              - throughput
              
  Share vision and knowledge  
    How to create SRE culture?
      1. Create a unified vision
        - team vision statement
        - support the company's vision
          - give sense of direction

          - strategy
            - how it'll realize its mission
            - can be a single initiative
            - can be leveraged
            - requires change
        
            Strategy building blocks
              - look outside: to identify threats and opportunities
              - look inside:to understand resource, capabilities and practices
              - consider strategies for addressing threats and opportunities
              - create alignment on communicating and coordinating work processes
                    
          - Goals
            - aligns your team to what you strive to attain

            Samples:
              Google:
                - OKRs
                  - objectives
                  - key results
                  - idea of OKRs is to set very ambitious goals
                    - enable you to accombplish more than the team thought was possible
                    - encourage to try new things
                    - prioritize work
                    - learn from both successes and failures

      2. Determine what collaboration/Communication looks like
        - high priority for SREs
        - common approaches to platforms
        - focus on problem-solving

        Practices
          1. Service-oriented meetings(Comm)
            - team review the state of service 
              - to increase awarenes, involvement and and improve operations
            - weekly 30-60 minutes
            - designated lead
            - compulsory attendance
            - set agenda

          2. Have a good team composition roles(Comm)

            - Manager
              - who runs performance management
            - Project Manager
              - who comments on a design doc and writes code

          Notes:
            SREs
              - make recommendation about architecture and software behaviors
              - adept at performing more than one job function and have the skills to step into another is needed
              
      3. Share knowledge among teams/Knowdlege sharing
          - cultivates knowledge sharing among its team members

          Ways/Practices
            1. Cross-training
              - a key competency when hiring SRE
              - involves training employee for flexible response to chaning production schedules
              - trains team memebers to be flexible
                - train employee other job role other than his hired role scope
              - helps reduce costs
              - improves morale
              - reduces turnover
              - boosts productivity
              - enhances scheduling flexibility
              - increases job satisfaction

            2. Employee-to-employee network
              - employees can develop adn grow by teaching others

              Sample
                - Google does this with g2g
                  - volunteer teaching network
                    - teaching courses
                    - 1 to 1 mentoring
                    - designing learning materials

              3. Job shadowing
                - expose new hires to what others in the team do every daily
                - expert knowledge and exposure to teammates
                - hands-on experience
                - opportunity to ask questions
                - introduction to the concept of gradual change
                - way to spot opportunity for cross-functional collaboration
                - way to understand the nuances of a particular job role
                - psychologically sage environments
                - way to pair up your team memebers to scale and retain knowledge

    Notes
      - Postmortems are SRE practice to help you learn from mistakes
      - Collaboration and knowledge sharing fosters delivering postmortems

    Benefits of collaboration technology
      - Real-time collaboration
      - open commenting system
      - email notifications

    Germany Online Solutions Provider
      - reduce number of comm channels
      - descibe channles used for what purpose
      - tech that collaborate in real-time directly via comments or chat
      - use collaborative tools to creat SRE knowledge repo

  Quiz 
    1. What is one value SRE provides to an IT team?
      - Developers are enabled to work at a higher velocity while maintaining reliability.
        - 
    2. What are Site Reliability Engineers comfortable with?
      - Failure
    
    3. What is a reasonable degree of target reliability for an SLO?
      - 99.9%
        - 99.9% is a reasonable target for reliability as it is just short of 100% and still leaves room to focus on feature development.

    4. What can happen when team members don't feel psychologically safe?
      - Moments of learning are lost.
        - ple don’t speak up or ask questions in work environments with low psychological safety, therefore moments of learning are inevitably lost.

    5. What is your team's clear and compelling goal that it strives to achieve?
      - Mission

    Key Points
      - DevOps emerged to help close gaps and break down silos bet development and operations teams
      - DevOps is a philosopy, not a development methodology or technology
      - SRE is a practical way to implement DevOps philosophy
      - Developers focus on feature vlocity and innovation; operators focus on reliability and consistency
      - SRE consists of both technical and cultural Practices
      - SRE practices align to DevOps pillars:
        1. Reduce Organizational silos
          - Share ownership
        2. Accept failure as normal
          - Blamelessness
        3. Implement gradual changes
          - Reduce cost of failure
        4. Leverage tooling and automation

          - Measure toil and reliability


Module 4: Make Tomorrow Better than today
  - Continuous, gradual testing as well as automation are very important in SRE culture. 
  This module covers the SRE technical concepts of continuous integration, continuous delivery, 
  and canarying as they relate to the DevOps pillar of implementing...

  Learning Objectives
    1. Describe the technical fundamentals of SRE: 
      - CI/CD, 
      - canarying, and 
      - toil automation
    2. Describe the cultural fundamentals of SRE: 
      - Design thinking
      - prototyping
      - psychology of change, and 
      - resistance to change

  Continuous integration, delivery and canarying
    Developers
      - moonshot thinking
        - implment massive software changes that have a high likelihood of failing

    SRE 
      - gradual change
        - smalle changes that have less impact on users if they fail

    CI/CD
      CI
        - building, integrating and testing code w/in dev environment
      
      CD
        - deploying to production frequently, 
        or at the rate the business chooses

      Processes
        1. Code
        2. build
        3. Integrate
        4. Test
        5. Release
        6. deploy
        7. operate

      Benefits
        1. Helps to overcome agile transformation challenges
        2. can min code integrations headaches
        3. reduces human error
        4. promotes higher code quality
        5. easier to "recover" after soemthing goes wrong
        6. can automate everything, which saves time and money
        7. provides visibility on project completion
        8. time to market is shorter
        9. provides you w/ more metrics to review and act on

    Canarying
      - advance warning of danger
        - small thing detects danger as we go into the unknown
      - deploying change in service to a group of users who don't know they are 
      receiving the cahnge, evaluating the impact to that group,
      then deciding how to proceed.

      Canarying requirements
        1. Canary population should be large enough to be a rep subset of the control
        The only diff should be the production change.

        2. Canary population should be small enough not to endanger the whole service if broken
        
        3. Canary should not be overly complicated for those who monitor it

  Design Thinking and prototyping
    Design Thinking
      - combines creativity and structure to solve complex problems
      - teach teams and individuals to thingking creatively for innovation

      5 phases
        1. Emphatize
          - observe and engae w/ intended users
          - immerse in their environments
        
        2. Define the problem you are attempting to solve
          - express the problem in the point of view of the users

        3. Ideate    
          - generate ideas for Solutions

        4. Time prototype
          - ideas into real world
            - identify best possible solution before communicating
        
        5. Test
          - test prototype in real world setting w/ your intended users

      Software Dev approach
        1. focus on user
        
        2. 10x thinking

        3. prototype to test your solution

    Prototyping 
      Benefits
        - more ideas are tested
        - faster failures means more successes

      Ways to prototype
        1. physical prototypinh
        2. paper and drawing
        3. clickable
        4. Role play
        5. video

      Sample  
        - video panel of discussion

        - banner w/ posted Notes

      Real life Sample
        - use design thinking methodology
          - branstorm about changes to their production processes
          
        prototype
          - use diff color of cups rep each step in teh process needed to be improved or depracted

  Toil Automation
    - if  a human operator need to touch your machine system during normal operations
    means you have a bug. The definiotion of normal changes as your sys grows
    - focus on development rather than operational work/toil
      - SREs eliminate toil by automating it.
     
    Notes
      - DevOps philosophy
        - leverage tooling and automation

    Toil
      - work I don't like to do
      - manual
      - repetitive
      - automatable
      - tactical
      - w/o enduring enduring value
      - scales linearly as the service grows
      - admin work that is not necessary or volatile

    Excessive toil
      1. Career stagnation

      2. Low morale

    2. What would be the best way to practice canarying?
      - Deploy a small feature change to users that are a representative subset of your typical customers.

    3. Why is toil a problem?
      - It becomes toxic in large quantities.
        - Toil becomes a problem and is toxic when it occurs in large quantities, as it takes SRE’s time away from real project work.

      -  An opportunity
        - Since resistance to change is usually a fear of loss, presenting change as an opportunity helps motivate employees to embrace and accept it.

  Glossary
    1.Continuous integration
      - Building, integrating, and testing code within the development environment.
    
    2. Continuous delivery
      - Deploying to production frequently, or at the rate the business chooses.
    
    3. Canarying
      - Deploying a change in service to a group of users who don’t know they are receiving the change, evaluating the impact to
        that group, and then deciding how to proceed.
    
    4. Toil
      - Work directly tied to a service that is manual, repetitive, 
      automatable, tactical, or without enduring value, or that scales
      linearly as the service grows. 

  Key Points
    - change is best when small and frequent
    - design thinking methodology 5 phases:
      - Emphatize
      - define
      - Ideate
      - prototype
      - test
    - prototyping culture
      - encourages teams to try more ideas
      - leading to increase faster failures
        - more successes
    - excessive toil is toxic to the SRE role
    - eliminating Toil  
      - SRE can focus on work that either:
        - reduce future toil
        - add service feautures
    - resistance to change is usually a fear of loss
    - present change as an oppportunity, not a threat
    - people react to change in many ways
      - IT leaders need to understand how to communicate w/ and support each group

Regulate Workload
  - In this module, you'll learn about SRE practices around measuring everything,

   and data-driven decision making.

  Learning Objectives
    1. Describe the technical fundamentals of SRE: Measure toil and reliability, and monitoring
    2. Describe the cultural fundamentals of SRE: Goal setting, tansparency, and data-based decision making

  Toil and reliability

  Goal setting

  Quiz

      dress, or appear externally
  
  Key Points
    1. measure reliability w/ good service level indicators(SLIs)
    
    2. a good SLi correlates w/ user exp w/ your service; that is good SLi
    tells you when users are happy or unhappy

    3. measure toil by indetifiying it, selecting and appropriate unit of
    measure, and tracking the measurements continuously

    4. Goal-setting, transparency, and data-driven decision making are key components
    of SRE measurement culture
